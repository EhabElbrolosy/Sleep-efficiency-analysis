# Sleep-efficiency-analysis

## Project Objective

The **"Sleep Efficiency Dataset Analysis"** project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to sleep efficiency, providing insights into factors influencing sleep quality. The primary goal of this analysis is to understand patterns in sleep behavior and identify key variables that affect how efficiently individuals sleep.

## Key Features

### **Which season exhibits the highest sleep efficiency?**
By categorizing the year into different seasons using the **SWITCH Function** in **DAX**, we observed that **autumn** shows the highest sleep efficiency.  
What factors contribute to this outcome, such as increased physical activity during autumn?

---

### **How does caffeine intake influence sleep efficiency across different age groups?**
We divided individuals into age groups and analyzed the impact of various factors on sleep efficiency.  
Specifically, how does **caffeine** affect **females** in the **30-40 age range**, and how does it compare to its effects on other groups?

---

### **When is sleep efficiency at its highest?**
At what approximate time does sleep efficiency reach its peak across the dataset?

---

### **Does smoking have any noticeable impact on REM sleep patterns?**
---
### **What effect does smoking have on REM sleep rates across different age groups?
---
Tools Used : Power BI, Figma

### **How do alcohol, smoking, and caffeine affect overall sleep quality?**
What is the relationship between **alcohol**, **smoking**, and **caffeine** with **sleep quality**, and what is the magnitude of their impact?
